# Benchmarks presented at CLIN34

This repository contains the benchmarks presented at the 34th CLIN conference. The benchmarker is configurable, so it should be easily possible to add your own benchmark as long as the data for it is on the Hugging Face hub.

To run the benchmarker on one or more configurations, simply

```shell
python scripts/benchmark.py configs/**/*.yaml
```
